# Wifi-Phishing
**This software I have created is for research purposes only and is not intended for misuse.**


The purpose of the software is to steal people's credit card information

Description:
-In this software the user will be able to select a victim WiFi network, then the software will drop the selected network and launch a fake network with the same name of the   selected one, then everyone who was connected to the original network will connect to the fake network we aired and then for example I chose Pizza Hut as a phishing site.  Whenever a web surfer tries to connect to a pizza site he will get my phishing site,
then when he makes an order using the credit card the credit card details will come to me with the help of sniffing the packages.
-I also developed protection software for this type of attack.
Using Python, javascirpt, apachi server and more ..

**I will emphasize that there is almost no use of ready-made tools and all the tools I have created as can be seen in the code.**
